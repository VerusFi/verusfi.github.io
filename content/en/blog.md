### Where does the name VerusFi come from?

Verus means Truth in Latin, and Fi comes from finance.

The name represents our commitment to transparency, honesty, and building financial tools that operate on verifiable, open-source principles. In a world where financial systems are often opaque and controlled by gatekeepers, we believe that "true finance" must be based on cryptographic proof, decentralized infrastructure, and code that anyone can audit.

VerusFi stands for finance as it should be: transparent, accessible, and free.
