# About

VerusFi is an organization dedicated to building freedom technology and financial software that promotes individual liberty, privacy, and sovereignty in the digital age.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where financial systems are:

**Decentralized:** No single point of control or failure

**Transparent:** Open-source code that anyone can audit

**Permissionless:** Accessible to anyone, anywhere

**Private:** Protecting user confidentiality by default

## Our Focus

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Creating financial tools that operate without intermediaries, giving users direct control over their assets.

**Privacy-Preserving Technology:** Implementing cryptographic protocols that protect user data while maintaining system integrity.

**Self-Sovereign Identity:** Building identity systems where individuals control their own data and credentials.

**Open-Source Infrastructure:** Contributing to the commons through freely available, auditable code.
