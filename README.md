# Our mission

Since 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin to the world, a new technological era was born — an era of freedom, transparency, and decentralization. These innovations paved the way for a future where people can control their own money, their identity, and their digital destiny.

But despite the immense potential of these technologies, access to them remains restricted. Technical complexity, lack of user-friendly interfaces, and absence of practical education have created a barrier that separates millions of people from the power that decentralization can offer.

VerusFi organization was born to break down this barrier.

Our mission is to bring decentralized technologies within everyone's reach, transforming innovation into inclusion. We do this by supporting and developing open source projects that simplify the use of tools that liberate, tools that give people control over their own money, their privacy, and their future.

Through donations and collaborative funding, our nonprofit organization supports developers, educators, and creators who share this vision: a freer, fairer, and more autonomous world, built on decentralized foundations.

We believe that decentralization is the true infrastructure of human freedom.
